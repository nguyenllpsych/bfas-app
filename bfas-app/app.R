    traits: Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and 
    Openness/Intellect. These are not five different personality types: every 
    person has some level of each of these traits, and so a full personality 
    profile requires knowing your level on all five. Although they are typically
    labeled based on one end of the trait, all of them have an opposite end as 
    well that is just as important (for example, Extraversion versus Introversion).
    <br/><br/>
    
    In the Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS)â€”which you may complete on the next tabâ€”
    the five broad traits are each split into two narrower traits (called Aspects),
    based on psychometric and genetic evidence. 
    
    <ul>
		<li> Neuroticism: Withdrawal and Volatility </li>
		<li> Agreeableness: Compassion and Politeness </li>
		<li> Conscientiousness: Industriousness and Orderliness </li>
		<li> Extraversion: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness </li>
		<li> Openness/Intellect: Openness and Intellect </li>
		</ul><br/>
    
    <b>How to interpret your feedback</b><br/>
    
    Based on your answers, we estimated your scores on these five broad traits 
    and ten narrower aspects. To illustrate how your personality compares to 
    others, we compared your scores to thousands of other people who have taken 
    the BFAS to generate <b>percentile scores.</b> As an example, if you 
    received a score of 90 on Enthusiasm (an aspect of Extraversion describing 
    friendliness, sociability, and the tendency to experience high energy 
    positive emotions like joy and excitement), your score on that trait is 
    higher than that of 90% of people. With such a high Enthusiasm score, you 
    are probably more friendly, outgoing, and positive than most others. 
    Conversely, if you received a 5th percentile score, your score is higher 
    than 5% of people (and lower than 95% of people), meaning you are probably 
    reserved, quiet, and unexcitable compared to most others.
    <br/><br/>
    
    To help you understand what your score means for your personality, 
    we categorized your score on each trait as <b>low, below average, above average,
    or high.</b> Each category is accompanied by a description of typical patterns 
    of behavior, emotion, and cognition for someone falling in that category. 
    This feedback should be reasonably accurate, but it will not always be 
    perfectly accurate for everyone due to idiosyncrasies in the way people 
    answer the questions. Peopleâ€™s answers can be influenced by their mood, who 
    they compare themselves to, what they recall, and whether they hold a biased
    view of themselves. Some people might find adjacent categoriesâ€”or a 
    combination of categoriesâ€”to fit their personality better than their 
    assigned category. For example, someone scoring only slightly below average 
    in Enthusiasm might also refer to the descriptions of someone scoring above 
    average in Enthusiasm.
